### `About Project`

This is a web application that you can use to find new games to play using filters.\
I made this project with the intention of solving a real life problem I had, \
and the problem I wanted to solve was me struggling to find new games to play.\
Thanks to Rawg.io for letting me use their API to supply data on all the games. \
